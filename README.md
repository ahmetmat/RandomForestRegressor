# RandomForestRegressor
This project involves a Python script for predicting the closing price of the any index on a specified future date using a Random forest Regressor Model.

## Overview
This Python script predicts the closing price of the any index for a given future date using a RandomForestRegressor model from the scikit-learn library.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy

Ensure these libraries are installed. You can install them using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy
```
## Dataset

Your dataset should be in a CSV format with columns for the Date and the Closing Price. Example columns: 'Date', 'Now'

   ## Usage

1. Place your dataset in the root directory with the filename `dataset.csv`.
2. Ensure the dataset is in CSV format with 'Date' and 'Closing Price' columns.
3. Run the script to train the model and predict the price for the given date.
